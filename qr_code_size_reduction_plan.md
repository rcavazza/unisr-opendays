# QR Code Size Reduction Plan

## Current Implementation

The QR code is currently displayed in the `ConfirmationPage.tsx` component with the following structure:

```jsx
<div className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12">
  <img
    src={qrCodeUrl}
    alt="QR Code"
    className="w-full aspect-square object-contain"
  />
</div>
```

The current styling makes the QR code take the full width of its container (`w-full`) while maintaining a square aspect ratio (`aspect-square`).

## Problem

The QR code is currently too large, and we need to reduce its size by approximately one-third.

## Solution

We'll modify the CSS classes applied to the QR code image to reduce its size while maintaining its proportions. The recommended approach is to:

1. Change the `w-full` class to `w-2/3` (66.67% of the original size)
2. Add `mx-auto` class to center the image horizontally within its container

## Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `ConfirmationPage.tsx` file to update the QR code image styling:

```jsx
<div className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12">
  <img
    src={qrCodeUrl}
    alt="QR Code"
    className="w-2/3 aspect-square object-contain mx-auto"
  />
</div>
```

This change will:
- Reduce the QR code width to 2/3 of its original size
- Center the image horizontally within its container
- Maintain the square aspect ratio

## Expected Result

The QR code will be approximately 33% smaller than its current size while maintaining its proportions and readability.

## Next Steps

Since this change requires modifying a TypeScript file, we need to switch to Code mode to implement the changes.
