# Fix for Course Filtering Issue

## Problem

The current implementation is not correctly filtering courses based on the matchingCourseIds received from the frontend. Instead, it's using courseTypes derived from experiences, which results in all courses being included in the email instead of just the ones associated with the user.

## Root Cause

In server.js around line 1508, we're calling:

```javascript
const matchingCourses = getMatchingCourses(courseTypes, useAllCourses);
```

The issue is that we're passing `courseTypes` as the first parameter to `getMatchingCourses`, but we should be passing `matchingCourseIds` instead. The `courseTypes` variable is derived from the experiences, not from the matchingCourseIds that we're receiving from the frontend.

## Solution

Modify the server.js file to use `matchingCourseIds` as the filter criteria instead of `courseTypes`. Here's the specific change needed:

```javascript
// Current code
const useAllCourses = !matchingCourseIds || !Array.isArray(matchingCourseIds) || matchingCourseIds.length === 0;
logger.info(`Calling getMatchingCourses with returnAllCourses=${useAllCourses}`);
const matchingCourses = getMatchingCourses(courseTypes, useAllCourses);

// Modified code
const useAllCourses = !matchingCourseIds || !Array.isArray(matchingCourseIds) || matchingCourseIds.length === 0;
logger.info(`Calling getMatchingCourses with returnAllCourses=${useAllCourses}`);
// Use matchingCourseIds for filtering if available, otherwise fall back to courseTypes
const filterIds = useAllCourses ? courseTypes : matchingCourseIds;
logger.info(`Using ${useAllCourses ? 'courseTypes' : 'matchingCourseIds'} for filtering: ${filterIds.join(', ')}`);
const matchingCourses = getMatchingCourses(filterIds, useAllCourses);
```

This change ensures that:
1. If matchingCourseIds is provided, we use it for filtering
2. If matchingCourseIds is not provided, we fall back to using courseTypes
3. The useAllCourses flag still controls whether to return all courses or filter them

## Implementation Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to make changes to the server.js file
2. Apply the diff to server.js around line 1508
3. Test the changes by running the server and making a request to the API with matchingCourseIds
4. Verify that the email only includes the courses specified in matchingCourseIds

## Testing

Use the test_matching_course_ids.js script to test the changes:

```bash
node test_matching_course_ids.js
```

Check the server logs to verify that:
1. The matchingCourseIds are being received
2. The correct filter IDs are being used
3. The correct number of courses are being returned
4. The email only includes the courses specified in matchingCourseIds
