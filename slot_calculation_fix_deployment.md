# Slot Calculation Fix Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment plan for fixing the slot availability calculation issue in the application. The issue affects how available slots are displayed in the frontend, particularly for the experience "imdp-e-medicina-chirurgia-mani-2".

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Review and approve the implementation plan
- [ ] Create a backup of the current `slotCalculationService.js` file
- [ ] Ensure there are no active reservations in progress
- [ ] Notify relevant team members about the deployment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare the Environment

- [ ] Create a branch for the fix (e.g., `fix/slot-calculation`)
- [ ] Implement the code changes as outlined in the implementation plan
- [ ] Run local tests to verify the fix works as expected

### 2. Deploy to Development/Staging Environment

- [ ] Deploy the fix to the development/staging environment
- [ ] Verify that "imdp-e-medicina-chirurgia-mani-2" shows 19 available slots instead of 20
- [ ] Verify that other experiences show the correct number of available slots
- [ ] Test the reservation system to ensure it works correctly for all experiences

### 3. Deploy to Production Environment

- [ ] Schedule the deployment during a low-traffic period
- [ ] Backup the production database before deployment
- [ ] Deploy the fix to the production environment
- [ ] Verify that the fix works correctly in production

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Verify that "imdp-e-medicina-chirurgia-mani-2" shows 19 available slots in production
- [ ] Verify that other experiences show the correct number of available slots
- [ ] Monitor the application for any unexpected behavior
- [ ] Check server logs for any errors or warnings

## Rollback Plan

If any issues are encountered during or after deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Restore the backup of the `slotCalculationService.js` file
2. Restart the server
3. Verify that the application is functioning correctly
4. Notify the team about the rollback and the issues encountered

## Communication Plan

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Notify the development team about the planned deployment
- [ ] Inform stakeholders about the issue and the planned fix

### During Deployment

- [ ] Provide regular updates on the deployment progress
- [ ] Immediately report any issues encountered

### After Deployment

- [ ] Notify the team when the deployment is complete
- [ ] Share the verification results with stakeholders
- [ ] Document any lessons learned for future reference

## Timeline

- **Code Review**: [Date]
- **Development Environment Deployment**: [Date]
- **Production Deployment**: [Date]
- **Post-Deployment Verification**: [Date]

## Resources Required

- Developer to implement the fix
- QA engineer to verify the fix
- DevOps engineer for deployment support
- Product owner for final approval

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

1. The frontend shows 19 available slots for "imdp-e-medicina-chirurgia-mani-2" instead of 20
2. Other experiences show the correct number of available slots
3. The reservation system works correctly for all experiences
4. No new issues are introduced by the fix

## Documentation Updates

After successful deployment, update the following documentation:

- System architecture documentation
- Key format conventions
- Troubleshooting guide for slot calculation issues

## Conclusion

This deployment plan ensures a smooth and controlled implementation of the fix for the slot calculation issue. By following this plan, we can minimize the risk of disruption to the application and ensure that the fix works as expected.
