# Plan to Fix Data Submission from "/front"

## Issue Identified

When submitting data from the "/front" path, the data doesn't appear to be saved. After investigating the code, I've identified the following issues:

1. The `/api/update-selected-experiences` endpoint exists in server.js, but it doesn't include the email sending functionality that's present in submit_email_route.js.
2. The apply_server_patch.js script, which is supposed to integrate this functionality, has a syntax error in its regular expression pattern.

## Root Cause

The apply_server_patch.js script contains an invalid regular expression with unmatched parentheses:

```javascript
const endpointPattern = /app\.post\('\/api\/update-selected-experiences'[\s\S]*?(?=app\.get\('\/selection')|$)/;
```

This causes a syntax error when running the script:

```
SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /app\.post\('\/api\/update-selected-experiences'[\s\S]*?(?=app\.get\('\/selection')|$)/: Unmatched ')'
```

## Solution Plan

### 1. Fix the Regular Expression in apply_server_patch.js

The regular expression needs to be corrected to properly match the endpoint in server.js. Here's the fixed version:

```javascript
const endpointPattern = /app\.post\('\/api\/update-selected-experiences'[\s\S]*?(?=app\.get\('\/selection')\)|$)/;
```

Alternatively, we can use a simpler pattern that's less prone to errors:

```javascript
const endpointPattern = /app\.post\('\/api\/update-selected-experiences'[\s\S]*?\}\);/;
```

### 2. Run the Fixed apply_server_patch.js Script

After fixing the script, run it to integrate the email sending functionality from submit_email_route.js into server.js:

```bash
node apply_server_patch.js
```

### 3. Verify the Integration

Check that the endpoint in server.js now includes the email sending functionality from submit_email_route.js.

### 4. Test the Endpoint

Test the endpoint by submitting data from the frontend and verifying that:
- The data is saved to HubSpot
- A confirmation email is sent to the user

## Implementation Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to edit the apply_server_patch.js file
2. Fix the regular expression pattern
3. Run the script to apply the patch
4. Restart the server
5. Test the endpoint by submitting data from the frontend

## Expected Outcome

After implementing this solution:
1. The `/api/update-selected-experiences` endpoint will include the email sending functionality
2. Data submitted from "/front" will be properly saved to HubSpot
3. Users will receive confirmation emails after submitting their data

## Fallback Plan

If the patching approach doesn't work, we can manually integrate the email sending functionality from submit_email_route.js into server.js by:

1. Identifying the current implementation of the endpoint in server.js
2. Replacing it with the implementation from submit_email_route.js
3. Ensuring all dependencies and imports are properly maintained
